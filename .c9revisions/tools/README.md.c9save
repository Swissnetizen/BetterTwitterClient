Do not modify this.\n\n### What comes out?\n\nAfter running the minify script, a new folder `build` will be located next to your `source` directory.\n\nIn it will be 4 files:\n- enyo.css\n- enyo.js\n- app.css\n- app.js\n\nThese files will be loaded in the given order by `index.html`.\n\n## Deployment\n\nThe deploy scripts included here will make a production ready copy of your application, and copy it into a packeagable folder.\n\n### How to run\n\nJust execute the platform specific `deploy` script.\n\n### What comes out?\n\nThe output of the `deploy` scripts will minify your appliaction, and copy the necessary files into `deploy/<appname>-<date>-<time>/`.\n\nIf the libraries have a compatible `deploy` script, they will be executed, and a minimal copy will be placed in the deployment's lib folder.\n\nIf no `deploy` script is found for the library, all of the library is copied into the lib folder to provide maximum safety.\n\nIf you are adding a library, please add a `deploy.sh` file and `deploy.bat` file similar to the ones in `lib/onyx`.\n\nIf no images or files are needed from the library, just include blank (and executable) copies of the deploy scripts.\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":2498}]],"length":2498}
